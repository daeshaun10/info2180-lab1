 <p>[My name is Daeshaun Gouldbourne. I am 18 years old. I was born at the Victoria
Jubilee Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica on the 10th of October, 2001. I currently live at
Bamboo Lane District, Crofts Hill, Clarendon in Jamaica. It is my dream to become an Information Technology Project Manager in the future. I
have had this dream since I was a child and I became fascinated with technology and completing tasks on computers and creating webpages.]</p>
